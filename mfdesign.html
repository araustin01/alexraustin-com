            In the fast-paced world of web and UI design, there's a growing movement that encourages designers to embrace
            simplicity over unnecessary complexity. This philosophy, often referred to as "Function Over Form," focuses on
            the idea that the beauty of a design lies in its functionality and usability rather than excessive embellishments.
            Inspired by the principles articulated on the irreverently named but insightful <span class="spoiler">motherfuckingwebsite</span> series, we delve into the
            essence of this design ethos.

            <h1>The Final Perfect Website</h1>
    
            The pursuit of simplicity is exemplified by the sentiment expressed on the <span class="spoiler">Motherfucking Website</span> series. The
            final  product, achieved with minimal CSS and HTML, boasts several key features:

            <h1>A Little More Accessibility</h1>
    
            In the current landscape of web design, there's an alarming trend towards unnecessary bloat, pushing the average webpage size to proportions <a
            href="https://www.wired.com/2016/04/average-webpage-now-size-original-doom/"> comparable to the original DOOM game.</a> 
            While this might be perceived as progress, it's crucial to acknowledge the digital divide that persists globally, particularly in regions without the luxury of high-speed broadband.
            <p>
            In the race for cutting-edge designs, influenced significantly by the proliferation of tools like Figma, designers often
            succumb to over-the-top elements. Dynamic animations, random popups, gamification, etc... may enhance the visual
            appeal for some users, but we must not overlook the stark reality that these elements render websites less accessible,
            especially in regions with limited internet infrastructure and slower hardware. The recent surge in elaborate and
            feature-rich designs, inadvertently leaving behind users who can't seamlessly load and interact with the essential content.
            <p>
            It's imperative for designers to pause and reconsider the impact of their creations on a global scale. A website's
            accessibility shouldn't be measured solely by its visual appeal but also by its ability to cater to users across diverse
            hardware and internet conditions.

            In a world where websites are often broken by default, the "Function Over Form" design principles remind us to
            prioritize functionality, high performance, and accessibility while making aesthetic considerations. It's a rallying cry
            for designers to collectively elevate the standard of web design from "total shit" to user-centric, efficient, and
            elegant solutions.
