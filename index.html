      <section id="about">
        <b>Hello there!</b> My programming journey began when I was 15, and since then my expertise in this field has exploded. I am now a Virginia Tech senior pursuing a bachelor's in Computer Science and Computational Modeling and Data Analytics (CMDA) with a minor in Mathematics, graduating this Spring (May '24).
        <p>
        I have explored concepts from all areas of Computer Science ranging from desktop application development to Big Data processing for Artificial Intelligence training sets.
        <p>
        My programming experience has taken me from fullstack development for websites like this one, to building, developing, and maintaining the very server that this website and many other applications are running on.
        <p>

          <article>
            <h4>Automation Development</h4>
            I have developed anything from PhP-based Web Scrapers to Python <a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank">Discord</a> bots. I have been fiddling with Machine Learning to tackle tasks that are almost impossible to automate with just a simple algorithmic approach.

            <h4>Web Development</h4>
            I am a full stack web developer with a focus on backend development. My 4+ years of web development experience gives me the confidence I need to complete any web-related project.

            <h4>Game Developer</h4>
            I build modifications for some of the most popular games (100+ million users). Most of my modifications are developed in Java and add gameplay functionality or management tools for a myriad of servers/clients. Some of my public resources have over thousands of downloads. My work has generated a dedicated following with close to a hundred unique individuals interested in my work, and who have either contributed by helping test, fork, and/or manage my opensource projects.
